This repository contains a [talk](https://sunnivin.github.io/hooked-on-hooks/talk/slides.html) and a [`demo`](https://github.com/sunnivin/hooked-on-hooks/tree/main/demo) for exploring how you can use the [`pre-commit`](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/)-package to enforce standards in a repository.
